# CBE 30338 Data Analytics, Optimization, and Control

This is a collection of class materials for CBE 303338 Data Analytics, Optimization, and Control taught at the University of Notre Dame. 

## Course Description

Dynamic modeling, data analytics, optimization, and control are essential to modern chemical technologies that enable precision medicine, sustainable energy, semiconductors, access to clean water, and beyond. In CBE 30338, students combine their knowledge of chemical engineering fundamentals (e.g., thermodynamics, transport, kinetics) and data analytics to develop dynamic models of diverse chemical technologies and processes. These models enable the design and optimization of control systems that use feedback to reject disturbances and drive systems to steady-state setpoints. CBE 30338 combines state-space modeling with modern computational and statistical methods to cover industrially relevant topics such as model predictive control, parameter estimation, and optimization. Students master techniques in hands-on experiments and a final semester project.
