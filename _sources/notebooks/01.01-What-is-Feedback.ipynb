This is the unit responsible for 'cracking' the long chain hydrocarbons found to create more valuable molecules that can be blended into gasoline.

When you here of explosions at refineries, often it is the outcome of some event involving operation of the FCCU.\n",

Watch the first 2-3 minutes for an excellent animation of FCCU operation. While you are watching the animation, ask yourself how this unit can be controlled to establish desired flowrates, prevent hazards, maximize the economic value of the products, and acheive product quality requirements. \n",
