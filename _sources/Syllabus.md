## Grading Criteria

### Class Participation

Students are expected to attend all class sessions.  If you miss class for an official University excused function, it is up to you to find notes for that lecture,  do the  reading, and avail yourself of office hours to catch up on the missed material.

Class sessions will include opportunities to respond to instructor questions and other active learning exercises. All interactions will be civil, respectful, and inclusive for all students. If you have any concerns about classroom dynamics, please feel free to speak with the instructor.

### Homework Assignments

Weekly homework assignments are scheduled for the course. Assignments are typically released on Tuesday and due before class the following Tuesday.  There will be no homework for the weeks including  Junior Parents’ Weekend,  Easter, and the final weeks when the semester project is underway.

Homework assignments are critical to developing the skills needed to succeed in the course and in the major. Accordingly, assignments are a required element of the course. Missing assignments will be scored as zero. Three or more missed assignments will result in an incomplete for the course. Group study is encouraged, but the submitted work must be your own. Students must be able to explain all of their submitted work.

### Laboratory Assignments

Laboratory assignments will be assigned in advance of each laboratory session and due the following Friday. 

### Quizzes

There will be one timed quiz following completion of each of the major units of the course. The quizzes will be conducted on-line outside of regularly scheduled class time.

### Final Project

The final project for CBE 30338 is in-depth exploration of a control problem of your choice. You will work in groups (at least three, no more than four, no exceptions), select a problem of interest, and develop an analysis or control design using the skills you learned in this course.  The essential elements of the project are:

* **Preliminary reports** consisting of a problem statement, a meeting with the instructor to review the project, and a progress report.

* A **Group presentation** to the class.

* A **Final Report** that includes at least one executable demonstration of your project. The executable element might consist of a Python/Jupyter notebook, a simulation prepared in an industry standard format, or video of experiment or hardware demonstration.
 
## Grading

Grades for CBE 30338 and CBE 32338 are consolidated into a single grade assigned to CBE 30338. There is no separate grade or credit assigned to  CBE 32338.

Grades are based on an assessment of performance in four major categories of work: individual homework assignments, quizzes, and laboratory assignments, and the group final project. The lowest homework, quiz, and laboratory assignment will be dropped. 

Students with a score of 95% or more of the total available points will earn an A for the course. Students with a score of 85% or higher will earn at least a B for the course. Detailed breakpoints for grades will be determined at the end of the semester.
