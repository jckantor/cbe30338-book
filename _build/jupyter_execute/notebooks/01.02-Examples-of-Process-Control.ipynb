    "\n",
    "The FCCU is a critical process in most refineries. This is the unit responsible for 'cracking' the long chain hydrocarbons found to create more valuable molecules that can be blended into gasoline. Operation of the FCCU involves a complex coordination of a large scale reactors, regenerators, distillation operating with the potential for catastrophic accidents. When you here of explosions at refineries, often it is the outcome of some event involving operation of the FCCU.\n",

    "The following video was created by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (USCSB) to demonstrate causes of an explosion in 2015 at an ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, CA.  Watch the first 2-3 minutes for an excellent animation of FCCU operation. While you are watching the animation, ask yourself how this unit can be controlled to establish desired flowrates, prevent hazards, maximize the economic value of the products, and acheive product quality requirements. \n",
