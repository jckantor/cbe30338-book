    "[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) is a state-of-the-art language for solving optimization problems embedded within Python. Using Pyomo, a user can describe optimization model by specifying decision **variables**, **constraints**, and an optimization **objective**. Pyomo includes a rich set of features to enable modeling of complex systems, specifying a solver, and displaying the solution."

An application may include tens, hundreds, even thousdands of variables and constraints, and may incorporate data extracted in real time from sensor networks and corporate data bases. The resulting models can be very complex, and essentially impossible to create and maintain without use of software tools.\n",

[GAMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Algebraic_Modeling_System) (General Algebraic Modeling System, https://www.gams.com/), first proposed in 1976, was among the first and still widely used. Other notable examples include [AIMMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIMMS), [AMPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPL), and [FICO XPRESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICO_Xpress).\n",
