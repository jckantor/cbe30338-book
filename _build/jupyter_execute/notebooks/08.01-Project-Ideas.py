# ## Simulation and Optimal Control of the Williams-Otto Process using Pyomo
# 
# The Williams-Otto process is a hypothetical process presented in a 1960 paper as a benchmark problem to investigate the use of advanced strategies for process control. At that time [Theodore J. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_J._Williams) and Robert Otto were process control engineers working at Monsanto Corporation. Williams later became a professor of engineering and director of the Purdue Laboratory for Applied Industrial Control at Purdue University.
# 
# Like others in the large chemical and oil companies of the era, they were investigating whether rapidly evolving computer technology of the era could be used to automate large scale chemical operations. Their paper offered a common framework for academics and industrial partners to compare the many competing proposals for advanced control systems. Sixty years later, the Williams-Otto process continues to benchmark system for the study of process control and dynamics.
# 
# The goal of this project is to produce a Python library to support the use of the Williams-Otto process in process control education. The deliverables will be a collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing the Pyomo model described in {cite}`schmid2020simulation`.

# ## Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Glucose-Responsive Materials for Drug Delivery
# 
# Diabetes afflicts many millions of people globally and places a substantial burder on health care systems. The automated delivery of insulin with pumps has improved the quality of life for many, and when coupled with glucose sensors and feedback control, can acheive a reasonable level of control over glucose levels. But these techniques require external devices and a great deal of care for successful operation.
# 
# New technologies have emerged in the form of glucose-responsive insulin for the delivery of Insulin. More recently, Prof. Matt Weber at Notre Dame has developed a glucose-responsive hydrogel for the delivery of glucagon, the enzyme antagonist to insulin. Together, these materials offer the prospect of high-fidelity control of glucose.
# 
# The goal of this project is to create a simulation model to study the combined use of these technologies to regulate glucose in the human body. The interaction of multiple feedback loops is expected to constrain the design of the materials. The models will be based on recent work by Prof. Weber and the simulation models developed in other laboratories. {cite}`bakh2017rational`, {cite}`yang2020connecting`,
