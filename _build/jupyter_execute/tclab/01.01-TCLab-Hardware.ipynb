    "# Setting up the Temperature Control Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Temperature Control Laboratory](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl) provides a low-cost, hands-on learning environment for process control. The Arduino-based device comprises a two-input, two-output system of heaters and sensors. [TCLab](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab) is a Python library providing the software tools to create and test control algorithms ranging from simple step testing to sophisticated multivarible predictive control.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Temperature Control Laboratory hardware consists of five components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Temperature Control Laboratory plug-in board (also known as a shield).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Five watt USB power supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 5.5mm to USB power supply cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. USB 2.0 data cable. (w/mini-USB connector for Arduino Uno, or micro-USB cable for Arduino Leonardo.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further, be sure to complete the steps outlined under *Hardware setup* as described in TCLab [README](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab/blob/master/README.rst). \n",
    "\n",
    "Mac OS users may need to install a serial driver available [here](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver). Normally the TCLab shield will already be mounted on the Arduino board, and the firmware driver will have been loaded on to the Arduino."
