# # First Order Model for a Single Heater

# ![](figures/arduino_comsol.png)
# 
# Mathematical modeling is an integral part of process control. The models come in many forms, ranging from the barest of information about a process to sophisticated simulation involving millions of computational nodes.  
# 
# Our purpose here is to demonstrate certain basic approaches that will provide with insight about the qualitative nature of process dynamics, how to construct simple models from first-principles understanding of the processes, and how to develop models in those circumstances when its not possible to start from first principles.
# 
# Our first example will be the Temperature Control Laboratory.
# 
# 
# * First-order lumped model for a single heater/sensor device.
# * Interacting first-order models for the dual heater/sensor.
# * Second-order model for a single heater/sensor device.
# * Interacting second-order model for the dual heater/sensor.

# ## First-order lumped model for heater/sensor device.
# 
# We'll be begin by writing a model for one of the heater/sensor pairs. We will assume the whole heater/sensor pair is at single uniform temperature $T_1$. Then we write a dynamic energy balance
# 
# \begin{align}
# C_p\frac{dT_1}{dt} & = U_a(T_{amb} - T_1) + P_1u_1 \\
# \end{align}
# 
# where $T_1$ is the combined temperature of heater/sensor one, $T_{amb}$ is the ambient temperature of the surroundings, and $u_1$ is a fraction of the maximum heater power $P_1$ being applied. The key parameters are the total heat capacity $C_p$ and the overall heat transfer coefficient with surroundings $U_a$.
# 
# 

# ### Steady State
# 
# We'll begin our analysis by investigating the steady-state response of this system to a steady-state input $\bar{u}_{1}$.  At steady-state all variables are constant so $\frac{dT_1}{dt} = 0$, which leaves 
# 
# \begin{align}
# 0 = U_a(T_{amb} - \bar{T}_1) + P_1\bar{u}_{1}
# \end{align}
# 
# Solving for $\bar{T}_{1}$
# 
# $$\bar{T}_{1} = T_{amb} + \frac{P_1}{U_a}\bar{u}_{1}$$
# 
# Next we'll load some experimental data that you can use to estimate the value of $U_a$.

# ## Loading previously saved experimental data
# 
# Previously a step test was performed in which the temperature control laboratory was initially at steady state at an ambient temperature of 21째C. The power to heater 1 was set to 50% for $P_1$ = 4.0 watts. Temperature $T_1$ and $T_2$ were recorded every second for a period of 800 seconds.
# 
# The data is in a file named "Step_Test_Data.csv". The following cell will attempt to read the data from the course github repository and store in a local file.

# In[5]:


import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jckantor/CBE30338/master/notebooks/TCLab/Step_Test_Data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)
data.to_csv("Step_Test_Data.csv")


# If that fails to work, then manually download the dat from this link https://github.com/jckantor/CBE30338/blob/master/notebooks/TCLab/Step_Test_Data.csv and save to the same directory as this notebook before proceeding.

# **Exercise:**  From this step test data and the steady-state analysis described above, estimate the value of $U_a$.

# ### Deviation Variables
# 
# In examining the response of the temperature control laboratory, we see the temperature is a deviation from ambient temperature, i.e.,
# 
# \begin{align}
# T_1' = T_1 - T_{amb}
# \end{align}
# 
# For process control purposes, we are often interested in the deviation of a process variable from a nominal value. In this case the choice of deviation variable is clearly obvious which is designated $T_1'$. From the steady state equation we see
# 
# \begin{align}
# \bar{T}_1' = \bar{T}_1 - T_{amb} = \frac{P_1}{U_a}\bar{u}_1
# \end{align}
# 
# which is a somewhat simpler expression.
# 
# Let's see what happens to the transient model. Substituting $T_1 = T_{amb} + T_1'$ into the differential equation gives
# 
# \begin{align}
# C_p\frac{d(T_{amb}+T_1')}{dt} & = U_a(T_{amb} - (T_{amb} + T_1')) + P_1u_1
# \end{align}
# 
# Expanding these terms
# 
# \begin{align}
# C_p\underbrace{\frac{dT_{amb}}{dt}}_{0} + C_p\frac{dT_1'}{dt} & = U_a(\underbrace{T_{amb} - T_{amb}}_{0} - T_1') + P_1u_1
# \end{align}
# 
# we see several terms drop out. The derivative of any constant is zero, and see a cancelation on the right hand side, leaving
# 
# \begin{align}
# C_p\frac{dT_1'}{dt} & = - U_aT_1' + P_1u_1
# \end{align}
# 
# One last manipulation will bring this model into a commonly used standard form
# 
# \begin{align}
# \frac{dT_1'}{dt} & = - \frac{U_a}{C_p}T_1' + \frac{P_1}{C_p}u_1
# \end{align}
# 
# Now let's recall some facts about first order differential equations.

# ### First Order Linear Differential Equations
# 
# A standard form for a single differential equation is
# 
# \begin{align}
# \frac{dx}{dt} & = ax + bu
# \end{align}
# 
# where $a$ and $b$ are model constants, $x$ is the dependent variable, and $u$ is an exogeneous input.  
# 
# #### Steady State Response
# 
# For a constant value $\bar{u}$, the steady state response $\bar{x}$ is given by solution to the equation
# 
# \begin{align}
# 0 & = a\bar{x} + b\bar{u}
# \end{align}
# 
# which is
# 
# \begin{align}
# \bar{x} & = -\frac{b}{a} \bar{u}
# \end{align}
# 
# #### Transient Response
# 
# The transient response is given by
# 
# \begin{align}
# x(t) & = \bar{x} + \left[x(t_0) - \bar{x}\right] e^{a(t-t_0)}
# \end{align}
# 
# which is an exact, analytical solution.
# 
# #### Apply to Model Equation
# 
# We now apply this textbook solution to the model equation. Comparing equations, we make the following identifications
# 
# \begin{align}
# T_1' \sim x \\
# -\frac{U_a}{C_p} \sim a \\
# \frac{P_1}{C_p} \sim b \\
# u_1 \sim u
# \end{align}
# 
# Substituting these terms into the standard solution we confirm the steady-state solution found above, and provides a solution for the transient response of the deviation variables.
# 
# \begin{align}
# \bar{x} = -\frac{b}{a}\bar{u} \qquad & \Rightarrow \qquad \bar{T}_{1}' = \frac{P_1}{U_a}\bar{u}_{1} \\
# x(t) = \bar{x} + \left[x(t_0) - \bar{x}\right] e^{a(t-t_0)} \qquad & \Rightarrow \qquad
# T_1'(t) = \frac{P_1}{U_a}\bar{u}_{1} + \left[T_1'(t_0) - \frac{P_1}{U_a}\bar{u}_{1}\right]e^{-\frac{U_a}{C_p}(t-t_0)}
# \end{align}

# ### Plotting the Analytical Solution
# 
# The following cell demonstrates use of these results to plot the transient response for a particular choice of model parameters. 
# 
# The steady state analysis provided an estimate for the gross heat transfer coefficient $U_a$. Rerun this cell for different values of gross heat capacity $C_p$. Try to find a value that at least mimics the experimental response shown above.

# **Exercise:** Determine values for $U_a$ and $C_p$. 
# 
# **Exercise:** The sum of absolute errors is shown on the chart. Try to find values of $U_a$ and $C_p$ that minimize this error criterion. In your opinion, is that the best choice of model parameters? Why or why not?

# ### Does this solution make sense?
# 
# The parameter values in the above plot were chosen to (at least roughly) reproduce the measured response of temperature control laboratory. The value used for the heat capacity was $C_p = 7$ watts/degC. Is this reasonable?
# 
# The [specific heat capacity for solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity) is typically has values in the range of 0.2 to 0.9 watts/degC/gram. Using a value of 0.9 that is typical of aluminum and plastics used for electronic products, the estimated mass of the heater/sensor pair would be
# 
# $$ m \approx \frac{7 \mbox{ watts/degC}}{0.9 \mbox{ watts/degC/grams}} \approx 8 \mbox{ grams}$$
# 
# Does that seem reasonable?
