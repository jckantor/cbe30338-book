# The Temperature Control Laboratory

The [Temperature Control Laboratory](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl) provides a low-cost, hands-on learning environment for process control. The Arduino-based device comprises a two-input, two-output system of heaters and sensors. 

[TCLab](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab) is a Python library providing the software tools to create and test control algorithms ranging from simple step testing to sophisticated multivarible predictive control.

Temperature Control Laboratory hardware consists of five parts:

1. Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board with preinstalled firmware.

2. The Temperature Control Laboratory plug-in board (also known as a shield).

3. Ten watt USB power supply.

4. USB to 5.5mm to USB power supply cable.

5. USB to micro-USB data cable.

Check your kit to be sure you have all parts.
