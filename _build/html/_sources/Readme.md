# CBE 30338 Chemical Process Control

This is a repository of class materials for CBE 303338 Chemical Process Control taught during the Spring 2022 semester. This repository includes existing materials materials from other repositories (notably CBE 30338 and CBE 32338), adds new materials, for access by students, teaching assistants, and other interested parties.

## Course Information

**Dates:** January 11 - April 21, 2022

**Section:** CBE 30338-01 Tuesday and  Thursdays, 12:30 - 1:45 pm, DeBartolo 138

**Lab/Tutorial Sections:**  You must be registered for one of these lab/tutorial sections.
* CBE 32338-01 Friday, 11:35 am - 12:25 pm, Fitzpatrick A68
* CBE 32338-02 Friday, 12:50 am - 1:40 pm, Fitzpatrick A68

**Prerequisites:** This course assumes knowledge of modeling and analysis with differential equations, and procedural programming in Python. Students taking this course will normally have completed

* CBE 20258 Numerical and Statistical Analysis
* MATH 20580 Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (or ACMS equivalent)
* MATH 30650 Differential Equations (or ACMS equivalent)

The models encountered in this include basic models for heat and mass transfer encountered in the usual coursework in Chemical Engineering. Students without these prerequisites should consult the instructor before enrolling. Students with background in Matlab, but no Python, should prepare for the course with with some self-study of Python.

**Required Materials:** 
1. [Temperature Control Lab kit](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl) is an Arduino based device that will be used in this course as a "hands-on" laboratory for learning process control. You will need to purchase the device for your use. The device is available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TCLab-Temperature-Control-Lab/dp/B07GMFWMRY) for $35 USD with free shipping for Prime members, or from [Apmonitor.com](https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/PurchaseLabKit) with payment by credit card.
2. A laptop/desktop computer with USB port.
3. An up-to-date installation of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) toolkit for Python programming. Follow the instructions [here](https://appdividend.com/2020/05/12/how-to-update-anaconda-upgrade-anaconda-navigator/) to update an older installation.
